          <h3>What is a Class?</h3>
          <p>
          A Class is a way of organizing information. We have actually already been using built-in Ruby Classes without specfically addressing it. When you used <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/">ruby-docs</a> to look for information on which methods to use, you can see that each method is organized under Class headings. For example, in my previous blog post concerning <a href="./t3-arrays-hashes.html">Arrays vs. Hashes</a>, both Array and Hash are examples of Ruby's built-in Classes.
          </p>
          <p>
          Using the same examples from my Array vs. Hash blog post, you can see this by calling the method #class as shown below:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  >> ["Monday", 2, "Wednesday", 4].class
  => Array
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code>
  >> {"Hotdog"=>2.99, "Burger"=>4.99,"Soda"=>0.99,"Popcorn"=>1.99}.class
  => Hash
          </code></pre>
          <p>
          You can even see what methods are stored under each Class by calling #methods. I'll only show the example for Array because this can get a lengthly since it shows all of the methods:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  >> Array.methods
  => [:[], :try_convert, :allocate, :new, :superclass,
  :freeze, :===, :==, :<=>, :<, :<=, :>, :>=,
  :to_s, :inspect, :included_modules, :include?,
  :name, :ancestors, :instance_methods,
  :public_instance_methods, :protected_instance_methods,
  :private_instance_methods,:constants, :const_get,
  :const_set, :const_defined?, :const_missing,
  :class_variables, :remove_class_variable,
  :class_variable_get, :class_variable_set,
  :class_variable_defined?, :public_constant,
  :private_constant, :singleton_class?, :include,
  :prepend, :module_exec, :class_exec, :module_eval,
  :class_eval, :method_defined?, :public_method_defined?,
  :private_method_defined?, :protected_method_defined?,
  :public_class_method, :private_class_method, :autoload,
  :autoload?, :instance_method, :public_instance_method,
  :nil?, :=~, :!~, :eql?, :hash, :class, :singleton_class,
  :clone, :dup, :itself, :taint, :tainted?, :untaint,
  :untrust, :untrusted?, :trust, :frozen?, :methods,
  :singleton_methods, :protected_methods, :private_methods,
  :public_methods, :instance_variables, :instance_variable_get,
  :instance_variable_set, :instance_variable_defined?,
  :remove_instance_variable, :instance_of?, :kind_of?,
  :is_a?, :tap, :send, :public_send, :respond_to?, :extend,
  :display, :method, :public_method, :singleton_method,
  :define_singleton_method, :object_id, :to_enum, :enum_for,
  :equal?, :!, :!=, :instance_eval, :instance_exec,
  :__send__, :__id__]
          </code></pre>
          <p>
          Now that was very long...
          </p>
          <p>
          So as you can see, Class is just a way of organizing information and we have already been using Ruby's built-in Classes. Even Integer and String are examples of Classes. To get the full list, you can look at the list on the left-hand side of <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/">ruby-docs</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>When to use?</h3>
          <p>
          A Class is used when you want to organize information. When you have a lot of methods and variables that all fall under a common theme, you can group them into a Class. That way you can keep reusing the information and it is convenient for you to edit. This is useful for when you start to make your own Classes.
          </p>
          <h3>How to use?</h3>
          <p>
          Let's go ahead and try creating a Class from a real-world example of going to a restaurant. First, we need to make a Class named Restaurant.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  class Restaurant

  end
          </code></pre>
          <p>
          Next, we should think about what we want it to do first when it is run. This is called the <b>initialize method</b>. In our case, I want the Class to take the name of the restaurant and your order as its arguments and print a greeting string.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  class Restaurant
    def initialize(name, food)
      p "Welcome to #{name}"
    end
  end
          </code></pre>
          <p>
          Now we can think of what kind of variables and methods to put into our Class. Methods would be actions that you can call on the Class. In our example, Restaurant, we can create the methods: eat and leave.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  class Restaurant

    def initialize(name, food)
      p "Welcome to #{name}"
    end

    def eat
    end

    def leave
    end
  end
          </code></pre>
          <p>
          Now that we have more than one method, we are going to start running into problems with our <b>local variable</b>, name. This variable will only work in #initialize. In order to make it work in #eat and #leave, we will need to make them into <b>instance variables</b> by assigning them with the @ symbol. I will go ahead and do that in #initialize for variables name and food.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  class Restaurant

    def initialize(name, food)
      @name = name
      @food = food
      p "Welcome to #{@name}"
    end

    def eat
      p "You ate the #{@food}"
    end

    def leave
      p "You left #{@name}"
    end
  end
          </code></pre>
          <p>
          Now lets go ahead and run our code to see what prints. First step is to create a new restaurant example. Then I will call #eat and #leave on it.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  >> example = Restaurant.new("InnOut", "fries")
  => "Welcome to InnOut"
  >> example.eat
  => "You ate the fries"
  >> example.leave
  => "You left InnOut"
          </code></pre>
          <p>
          Everything works the way we expected it to! Congrats, you have just created your first Class.
          </p>
