        <h2>"You shall not pass!" - Gandalf</h2>
        <h4>July 25, 2015</h4>
          <p>
          Just as you have been taught in math class, a variable is a symbol that is assigned a value. In the case of Ruby, there are 4 variables: local, instance, class, and global.  They are used in different cases where there are certain levels they can 'pass'. Local variables can only pass one level while global variables can pass all of them. This can get confusing but luckily, Ruby makes variables very easy to distinguish by how they are called.
          </p>
          <h3>Local Variable: lower case letters</h3>
          <p>
          Local variables are named with lower case letters and underscore, "local_variable". They are only valid in the local area of the code it is called. For example, if the local variable is called inside a method, that variable only exists in the method. If you try to call it outside the method, you will get an error.
          <pre><code>
  def num
    local_var = [1, 2]
  end

  >> p num
  => [1, 2]

  >> p local_var
  => NameError: undefined local variable or method
  `local_var' for main:Object
          </code></pre>
          </p>
          <p>
          In the example above, I created a local variable in my method num. Since this is a local variable that was created within the method num, it is local to the method. It cannot be accesses outside of the method. As you can see, from my example, when I called p local_var, terminal gave me an error.
          <h3>Instance Variable: @</h3>
          <p>
          Instance variables are named with the @ symbol, "@instance_var". They are accessed with a specific instance of an object. Without calling an instance of the class first, the instance variable cannot be accessed.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  class Calculator
    def initialize(array_of_num)
      @nums = array_of_num
    end

    def add_five
      @nums.map!{|num| num + 5}
    end
  end

  >> example = Calculator.new([1, 2])
  >> p example
  => #<Calculator:0x000000018f63c0 @nums=[1, 2, 3]>
  >> p example.add_five
  => [6, 7]
          </code></pre>
          <p>
          Here I created an instance of class Calculator and named it example. I then called the method add_five. Method add_five takes the instance variable, @num, and changes it where five is added each time. When I call example, you can see that it was initialized with [1, 2]. Once I called add_five, @num returns [6, 7]. As you can see, the instance variable carries the variable, @num from the initialize to add_five.
          </p>
          <h3>Class Variable: @@</h3>
          <p>
          Class variables are named with @@, "@@class_var". They are like instance variables except they can be accessed in all instances of a class. This means that in the case where one instance of object changes the class variable, it is changed for all other instances as well. The class variables carry over throughout all instances of a class.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  class Calculator
    @@array_of_all_num = []
    def initialize(array_of_num)
      @nums = array_of_num
    end

    def add_five
      @nums.map!{|num| num + 5}
    end

    def combine
      @@array_of_all_num << @nums
    end
  end

  >> example = Calculator.new([1, 2])
  >> p example.add_five
  => [6, 7]
  >> example.combine
  => [[6, 7]]
  >> example2 = Calculator.new([4, 5])
  >> p example2.add_five
  => [9, 10]
  >> p example2.combine
  => [[6, 7], [9, 10]]
          </code></pre>
          <p>
          The above example is built on the previous example. All I did was add a class variable, @@array_of_all_num and a new method which would push the add_five array to a class variable, @@array_of_all_num. I named my first instance of class Calculator "example" and my second instance "example2". When I called combine on "example2", since @@array_of_all_num is a class variable, it remembered the data I had stored from "example". That is why my result from calling combine on example2 resulting in [[6, 7], [9, 10]]. The class variable passed in between all instances of the class.
          </p>
          <h3>Global Variable: $</h3>
          <p>
          Global variable are named with $, "$global_var". They can pass through all everything. The below example shows exactly what that means
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  $global = "hi"

  def method_example
      puts "Inside method"
      puts $global
  end

  class Some_example
    def initialize
      puts "Inside class"
      puts $global
    end
  end

  >> method_example
  => Inside method
      hi
  >> class_example = Some_example.new
  => Inside class
      hi
  >> p $global
  => hi
          </code></pre>
          <p>
          I assigned a global variable, $global, with the string "hi". Even though I named $global in a class and method example, I will still able to call them.
